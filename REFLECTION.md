1. Were your predictions right?

I correctly predicted that the highest coffee intace doesn't result in best focus. My prediction that I am mostly chill was correct. I was also right that longer sleep for me doesn't always result in high productivity. 


2. What surprised you?

I was surprised to see the Hangovered day affected my focus. Even with the most sleep that day, my focus was just 2.


3. What was tricky or rewarding?

The trickest part for me was getting into the habit of properly constracting my for loops.


4. How did using your own data change things?

Using my own data made me realize how helpful coding can be for tracking my habits and therefore making better choice. For example, realizing that I don't need 3 cups of coffee to be more productive.
